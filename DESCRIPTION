Description: Amateur research work in algorithm composition, manipulation and analysis. This package makes it possible to:    - compose algorithms programmatically from:        - Truth tables,        - NAND atomic function,        - derived logical gates,        - complex graphs built from the above building blocks,    - manipulate algorithms with flexibility,    - analyse algorithms properties and visualize algorithms graphs.
