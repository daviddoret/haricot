## Definition

In the context of the *haricot* package, two modular binary numbers are equal if and only if they have identical dimensions and all their corresponding bits are equal.  

# Formal definition

$$\forall B_{a},B_{b} \in \mathbb{B}^{d}, B_{a} = B_{b} \Leftrightarrow \forall i \in [1,...,d], B_{a}[i] = B_{b}[i]$$
It follows from this definition that if two *modular binary numbers* are equal, they are iso-dimensional.

$$ \forall B_{a},B_{b} \in \mathbb{B}, B_{a} = B_{b} \Leftrightarrow , dim(B_{a}) = dim(B_{b}) $$

## Inequality of modular binary numbers for equal mapped integers

A consequence of this definition of equality is that 2 modular binary numbers may be unequal but be mapped to the same natural number. 

$$\forall B_{a},B_{b} \in \mathbb{B}, int(B_{a}) = int(B_{b}) \nRightarrow B_{a} = B_{b}$$

Example:

$$b0000 \neq b00 \land int(b0000) = int(b00)$$
