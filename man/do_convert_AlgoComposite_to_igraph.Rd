\title{Convert an object of type AlgoComposite to an igraph object.}
\usage{
g <- convert_AlgoComposite_to_igraph(node, ...);
}
\arguments{
\item{node}{The node that we want to graph (AlgoComposite)}

\item{...}{For future usage.}
}
\value{
A directed network graph representation of the node (igraph).
}
\description{
The igraph network will be composed of:
* One node per input bit,
* One node per algorithm,
* One node per output bit,
* Directed edges from the input bits to the algorithm node,
* Directed edges from the algorithm node to the output bits,
* Directed edges between sub-algorithms.
